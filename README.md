# Yat Coding Challenge



# Usage Instructions

Install dependencies and compile typescript
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

In order to run test suite use `npm run test` no need to build before testing.

If you want to run the application either use ts-node via `npx ts-node index.js <commands>` or `npm run start -- <commands>` if using the npm run style make sure you build first.

Ensure that you have provided a proper .env file before running the application or tests.

Provided commands
```bash
query # fetches payment addresses
append # adds a new payment address
```

To query a yat's payment addresses use `npx ts-node index.js query --yat ‚ò†Ô∏èüêô‚ò†Ô∏è`.
You can filter by currency name i.e `npx ts-node index.js query --yat ‚ò†Ô∏èüêô‚ò†Ô∏è -c Bitcoin Address`

To add a bitcoin address `npx ts-node index.ts append --yat ‚ò†Ô∏èüêô‚ò†Ô∏è  -c TRON -a DHKM6NDUUv9kaHAGi1QU7MRBNKfQiAdP3F`

For additional usage and help use `npx ts-node index.js query --help` or `npx ts-node index.js append --help`

## Note

In your env file make sure you use the base url for API_URL i.e `https://demo-yc.scratch.emojid.me/` not `https://demo-yc.scratch.emojid.me/api`.

## Summary

Using Javascript / Typescript, create a CLI app that looks up Yat payment addresses, and additionally allows the user to set new payment addresses.

## Requirements

Create a CLI app that takes command line parameters as inputs.
### Fetching data

Lookup the payment addresses of the supplied Yat, optionally only displaying the specified currency requested.

* A required argument of `-y|--yat` must be supplied that accepts a Yat (an emoji string) that is:
    *  Between `MIN_YAT_LENGTH` and `MAX_YAT_LENGTH` long, from the environment variables.
    *  Only contains characters found in `data.emojis` from the included data.js file
*  If a currency type argument is provided `-c|--currency` then only return the tag data for that specific currency's address.
*  If no other arguments are provided return all payment addresses with their "friendly" names.

### Writing data

Add a new payment address for the provided Yat.

* A required argument of `-y|--yat` must be supplied that accepts a Yat (an emoji string) that is:
    *  Between `MIN_YAT_LENGTH` and `MAX_YAT_LENGTH` long, from the environment variables.
    *  Only contains characters found in `data.emojis` from the included data.js file
*  A required currency type argument `-c|--currency` that accepts a friendly name or the currency code.
*  A required address argument `-a|--address` that accepts a wallet address value.
*  An optional description argument `-d|--description` that accepts a name for the wallet.

### Handy resources

* Documentation on payment addresses https://api-docs.y.at/docs/categories#cryptocurrency-addresses
* Documentation for authenticated requests for writing using `X-Api-Key` https://api-docs.y.at/docs/api-ref#authentication
* Looking up payment addresses https://api-docs.y.at/docs/api-ref#lookup-emojiid-payment-addresses
* Adding data to a Yat https://api-docs.y.at/docs/api-ref#edit-emojiid (P.S. You do not need to supply the `merkle_root` or the `signature`)
* List of valid emojis and address display names are included in `data.js`

### Caveats

* Only fetch, display and update data for CryptoCurrency Addresses `0x10**` and not Crypto Tokens `0x63**`.
* An `emoji_id` is equivalent to a `Yat`

### What we're looking for

* Clean code
* Comments (where they make sense)
* Use of libraries (no need to re-invent the wheel)
* Commit history, commit often to show your thought process
* Tests are a plus
